# WolfBot

This bot I made for a Discord server checks the account's age based on the user's discord account id or on their discord name.

Also, it checks if a link is safe or not, using https://www.ipqualityscore.com api.

In order to use the api, create an account on the website mentioned above, you'll be redirected to the dashboard after you login. Then, enter the documentation by clicking on the 'View API docs' button. On the new browser window that was opened, click on 'Malicious URL Scanner API' and there, you can find the key for your API
